Data science is present in every aspect of the mission. NSA Data Scientists tackle challenging real-world problems leveraging big data, high-performance computing, machine learning, and a breadth of other methodologies. We are looking for critical thinkers, problem solvers, and motivated individuals who are enthusiastic about data and believe that answers to hard questions lie in the yet-to-be-told story of diverse, complicated data sets. You will employ your mathematical science, computer science, and quantitative analysis skills to develop solutions to complex data problems and take full advantage of NSA's capabilities to tackle the highest priority foreign intelligence and cybersecurity challenges. As a Data Scientist, your responsibilities may include: - Exploratory data analysis and exploratory model-fitting to reveal data features of interest - Machine-learned predictive modeling - Construct usable data sets from multiple sources to meet customer needs - Identifying and analyzing anomalous data (including metadata) - Developing conceptual design and models to address mission requirements - Developing qualitative and quantitative methods for characterizing datasets in various states. - Performing analytic modeling, scripting, and/or programming - Working collaboratively and iteratively throughout the data-science lifecycle - Designing and developing analytics and techniques for analysis - Analyzing data using mathematical and statistical methods - Evaluating, documenting, and communicating research processes, analyses, and results to customers, peers, and leadership - Creating interpretable visualizations.\n\nJob Summary\n\nData scientists are hired into positions either directly supporting a technical mission office or into the Data Science Development Program (DSDP). For the former, you will have the opportunity to collaborate with NSA's experts in the field of data science and other computational disciplines while tackling NSA's highest priority mission challenges. You will have opportunities to attend technical conferences with experts internally and from industry and academia as well as discuss and share NSA's challenges and successes at technical roundtables. The Data Science Development Program (DSDP) is a three-year opportunity to develop and enhance your data science skills. Participants experience the breadth of data science at NSA through six- to nine-month assignments in a variety of diverse organizations, and collaborate with NSA's experts in the field of data science. You will have opportunities to attend technical conferences with experts from industry and academia, and you will routinely discuss and share NSA's challenges and successes at weekly technical roundtables. You will study data science and related subjects taught by NSA experts. We foster an environment where you will develop your data science skills, while quickly contributing to NSA's highest priority mission challenges. Graduates of the DSDP may choose their first permanent assignments from any of the NSA Directorates.\n\nQualifications\n\nThe qualifications listed are the minimum acceptable to be considered for the position.
